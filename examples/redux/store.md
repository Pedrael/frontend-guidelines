Explanation of the [store.ts](./store.ts)

1. **Import Statements**:

   - `combineReducers`: A function from Redux that takes an object full of slice reducers and merges them into a single reducer function.
   - `configureStore`: A function from Redux Toolkit that simplifies the store creation process by wrapping some Redux functions.
   - `productSlice` and `orderSlice`: Your custom slices which define how the state for products and orders is updated.

2. **Store Configuration**:

   - `combineReducers`: It's used to combine the reducers from `productSlice` and `orderSlice`. The keys in the combined reducer object are based on the `name` properties of the slices, and the values are the reducer functions.
   - `configureStore`: It's used to create the Redux store with the combined reducer. The store knows how to handle actions that target the product and order slices of your state.

3. **State Types**:

   - `RootState`: A type that represents the complete state object in your Redux store. It is derived from the return type of the `store.getState` function, so it will automatically update if you add more slices or change the structure of your existing slices.
   - `AppDispatch`: A type that represents the dispatch method in your Redux store. It's specific to the store you've configured, so it knows about all the actions that your slices can handle.

4. **Export Statements**:
   - The store itself is exported as the default export, allowing it to be easily imported and used throughout your application.

In essence, this code sets up a Redux store that's ready to handle actions related to products and orders, as defined in the corresponding slices. It also provides TypeScript types that you can use to get type checking and autocompletion for your state and dispatch logic.
