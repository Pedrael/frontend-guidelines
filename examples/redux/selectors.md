The `createSelector` function from the `reselect` or `redux-toolkit` library is a helpful utility for computing derived data from the Redux store. It's particularly useful for performance optimization as it memoizes (caches) the results, ensuring that the function only recomputes when the inputs change.

Here's how you can use `createSelector` in conjunction with slices in Redux Toolkit:

### 1. Create a Slice

- [slices.md](./slices/slices.md)

### 2. Create Selectors using `createSelector`

- [selectors.ts](./selectors.ts)

### 3. Using the Selector in a Component

Now, you can use the selector in your component:

- [usage.ts](../usage.ts)

### Conclusion

By using `createSelector`, you can create efficient selectors that compute derived data from the Redux state. These selectors are memoized, so they only recompute when necessary, helping to improve performance, especially in large or complex applications.

Together with slices, selectors can help to create a clear and efficient state management structure for your application.
