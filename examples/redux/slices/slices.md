### 1. What are Slices?

When working with Redux, it's common to divide the global state into smaller, more manageable pieces that align with specific functions or features within your application. These pieces are referred to as "slices" of the state.

### 2. Why use Slices?

Managing a global state in a growing application can quickly become complex, with various actions, reducers, and selectors spread across different files and folders. Slices provide a way to encapsulate the logic for a specific part of the state, making the codebase more organized, readable, and maintainable.

### 3. How to create a Slice with Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit provides a utility function called `createSlice`, which accepts an initial state, an object containing reducer functions, and a slice name. It automatically generates action creators and action types, so you don't have to write them manually.

Here's a simple example of defining a slice for managing user information:

- [orderSlice.ts](./orderSlice.ts)
- [productSlice.ts](./productSlice.ts)

### 4. Using Slices in Components

Once you've created a slice, you can dispatch its actions and access its state in your React components using hooks like `useDispatch` and `useSelector`.

### Conclusion

Slices in Redux Toolkit help simplify and organize the Redux state management by grouping related logic and state into self-contained units. They promote a scalable and maintainable code structure and significantly reduce the boilerplate code commonly associated with traditional Redux.
